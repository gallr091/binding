			<p>At the heart of the Walker Art Center’s—and Walker Reader’s—mission is a call to “examine the questions that shape and inspire us as individuals, cultures, and communities.” <mark class="highlight-link"><a href="https://walkerart.org/magazine/series/soundboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundboard</a></mark> embraces this aim by tackling myriad questions—sometimes thorny, sometimes philosophical, always, we hope, worth considering—that surround the work of making, presenting, understanding, and living with art. Through a single interface, an array of voices are invited to respond to a pressing cultural question of our time. </p>
