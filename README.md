Redesigning Design: Decolonization as Reckoning, Reclamation, and Transformation
-
This website is a collection of articles that serve as a call to reflect on the designer's within a society powered by systems of oppression. Doing this allows us to begin the process of decolonization in the context of how design is approached as a practice. 
+ "Design Thinking is a Rebrand of White Supremacy" by Darin Buzon (*reckoning* with our biases)
+ “Now You See It: Helvetica, Modernism, and the Status Quo of Design” by Jen Wang (*reclaiming* agency)
+ "How will we queer design education without compromise?" by Kristina Ketola Bore (*transforming* design practice)

All pages have been typeset and coded by Rice Gallardo using HTML/CSS for their final project for Type and Interaction 1 (Fall 2024).
