Redesigning Design: Decolonization as Reckoning, Reclamation, and Transformation
-
This website is a collection of articles that serve as a call to reflect on our roles as designers within a society powered by systems of oppression:
+ "Design Thinking is a Rebrand of White Supremacy" by Darin Buzon (*reckoning* with our biases)
+ “Now You See It: Helvetica, Modernism, and the Status Quo of Design” by Jen Wang (*reclaiming* agency)
+ "How will we queer design education without compromise?" by Kristina Ketola Bore

All pages have been typeset and coded by Rice Gallardo using HTML/CSS for their final project for Type and Interaction 1 (Fall 2024).
